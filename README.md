# Binance++
Binance++ is a binance API wrapper built to be easy to port to other platforms.
I decided to make Binance++ after looking into the officially endorsed [Binacpp](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binacpp) and being unable to find any easy way to build for windows.
While I don't have a linux build environment set up to test the code, I hope through the use of CMake and good coding standards that, in the event someone does want a linux port, it wont be too hard to add.
